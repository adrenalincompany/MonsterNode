 technology to operate with no central authority: managing transactions
 and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network. MonsterNode Core

 .
 This package provides the daemon, monsternoded, and the CLI tool
 monsternode-cli to interact with the daemon.

 technology to operate with no central authority: managing transactions
 and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network. MonsterNode Core
 is the name of the open source software which enables the use of this currency.

 This package provides monsternode-tx, a command-line transaction creation
 tool which can be used without a monsternode daemon.  Some means of
 exchanging minimal transaction data with peers is still required.
